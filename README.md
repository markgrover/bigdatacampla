=============

Slides for my talk at Big Data Camp LA. Thanks to Jonathan Seidman from Cloudera for letting me use his slides.

Based on audience questions, I will probably add more slides on Hue (UI for everything Hadoop related), authentication and authorization (Kerberos and Sentry respectively), Cloudera Navigator (Data Audit and Access Control) in the next iteration.

Another question that was asked that I will likely not deal with in this presentation was how to size your cluster (cloud or in-premise) based on how much data and the type of data you have.
